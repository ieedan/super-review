Add a native context menu to discard a hunk or an individual line.

Previously you could stage individual lines but only discard whole files. Right-clicking a staging gutter control in the Unstaged working-tree diff now opens a native discard menu: the hunk button offers "Discard modified lines" (the whole section) and a line button offers "Discard modified line". The discard builds a working-tree-based patch — removing the discarded additions and restoring the discarded deletions — and applies it to the working tree only, leaving your index untouched. Discards stay recoverable since the removed lines remain in HEAD.
